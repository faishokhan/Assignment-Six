        <h1><u>Software Developer</u></h1>
        <p>A software developer is a professional who is responsible for the creation, testing, and maintenance of computer software. They use their knowledge of programming languages and software engineering principles to create software that meets the needs of users.<br>

            Software developers typically work in a team environment, collaborating with other developers, designers, and testers to bring a project to completion. They may also work independently, developing software for their own personal or professional use.</p>
